Github Pages repository for Aesthetic Function Graphposting

# Guidelines

You can add pretty much whatever projects you want here.  
However it's preferred you create your own repository under [AEFGP](https://github.com/AEFGP) if you don't need the pages hosting.

If you are contributing to someone else's project you should make a pull request so they can overview your changes to see how that meshes with their idea for their project.

For wiki pages, you can make formatting and other small improvements, but if you're changing major information or tone you should try to contact the main contributors of those pages.

If you add something that you intend to host through Github pages, you can modify the [index.md](https://github.com/AEFGP/AEFGP.github.io/blob/master/index.md) to link to the pages version of what you added as well as supporting material.
